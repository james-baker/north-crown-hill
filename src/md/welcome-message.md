Howdy neighbor,

You're receiving this email after providing your email address to me at your front door or at https://www.northcrownhill.com, in the interest of becoming more connected with your neighbors in this time of stress and uncertainty. Your email address will not be shared with anyone, for any purpose, without further affirmative consent.

I'm writing a periodic newsletter with the latest epidemic news for our neighborhood specifically. I have some examples here. If you get tired of it, you can click the "unsubscribe from this list" link at the bottom of any email.

We have a community hotline, to help us help each other! The number is 206-208-2899, and any resident of North Crown Hill may call and leave a message at any time - though we're especially excited that we now have a way to connect and support our neighbors who don't have the access or inclination to use the internet. Please don't share this number publicly (in order to avoid spammers), but do feel free to share it with fellow NCH residents and with family members.

Where do those voicemail messages go? The last piece of this community-building is an online chat room - our peer-to-peer Slack site at https://northcrownhill.slack.com - which you will receive a separate email invitation to join, usually a few minutes after this email. The hotline messages show up there, and you can sign up here if you'd like to join that neighbor support hotline-response team. Otherwise, we're mostly introducing ourselves at the moment, and I have more description here. And if chatting's not your cup of tea, feel free to ignore the Slack invite - that personalized invitation link should remain active for you if you want to come back to it.

If you know a neighbor who might like to join us, or if this is the wrong email address, or you lost your Slack invite or didn't receive it, or want to switch emails, or anything else, please just drop me a line at north.crown.hill@gmail.com.

Thanks, and talk to you soon!
James
