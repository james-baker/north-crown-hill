        <h1>About this project</h1>
        <p>This is a self-organized, unincorporated, 100% volunteer effort to strengthen the social fabric 
            of our mini-neighborhood. We need volunteers!</p>
        <p>Timeline so far:
            <ul>
                <li>Friday, March 13th: After a couple weeks of thinking, registered northcrownhill.com</li>
                <li>Saturday, March 14th: Created website, made a couple spreadsheets, and started knocking on doors</li>
                <li>Sunday, March 15th: Got up to 60 doors knocked, 25 contacts, launched newsletter and chat</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Goal #1: Make one warm contact with every household in the area.</p>
        <p>TODO list:
            <ul>
                <li>write data privacy and protection policy</li>
                <li>maybe create an actual task list for volunteers</li>
                <li>get all house addresses into the spreadsheet</li>
                <li>add data visualization of Goal #1 progress</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                    Hi friends, my name is James. My family and I have lived in this neighborhood for six years, and... 
                    have met very few of you, as I think is typical of modern city life. We all find our community connections 
                    mostly in our work, our schools, our churches, and other interest-based circles. We have less in common 
                    with those who literally surround us physically... but we share our city streets and our humanity, and 
                    in a time like this we may be the only community that <i>can</i> be there to help each other out. I'm 
                    "very online" (as the kids say) myself, and am eager to see how this blended meatspace+cyberspace experiment goes.
                </p>

        <h3>Why should you trust me with your data?</h3>
        <p>
            I've worked for a <a href="https://www.tableau.com">data visualization company</a> for the last dozen years.
            I believe strongly in the power of data to help, and also in the dangers of poorly managed data.  I've
            also had prior experience managing the personally-identifiable data of hundreds of coworkers while 
            preserving their anonymity. You choose how much data you want to share with which audiences.
        </p>
        <h3>Why should you invest your energy in this project?</h3>
        <p>
            Ultimately, this network will last as long as participants want and need it to.  I'll set it up so that 
            it doesn't rely on me long-term, should we find that it's a valuable community resource even when we're 
            not in crisis mode.  In the short-term... I am a capable project manager, verteran software engineer,  
            and the experienced founder and organizer of another <a href="https://twitter.com/tabempethicsall">all-volunteer organization</a>.
